Taumadhi is the next prominent square of the city where the awesome Nyatapolo temple exists which is Nepalâ€™s tallest 
ancient structure, built by King Bhupatindra Malla. It stands in five tiers and is balanced by the five foundation
 platforms that stand at the base. From as far back as you can stand, it looks like a fretted pyramid climbing up
 to the clouds, reaching a height of more than 30 meters. Its inspiration is said to have been a form of Bhairav, who 
stands in another nearby temple. Certainly no menace terrifies those who swarm over its plinth and up its steps, which 
are guarded on each side by legendary sentinels. Jaya Mal and Patta, two wrestlers said to have the strength of 10 men, 
are at the bottom. Next come two huge elephants, each 10 times stronger than the wrestlers, then two lions, each as strong
 as 10 elephants, two griffins, each as strong as 10 lions and finally on the uppermost plinth, two demi-goddess, Baghini
 in the form of tigress, and Singhini, as a lioness, each 10 times as strong as griffin. Siddhi Lakshmi, to whom the 
temple is dedicated, is consequently the most powerful of all these figures. She is depicted with other deities on the 
struts. Even the caretaker priests can only see the image of the goddess inside the temple and night. It is a pattern of 
guardian sentinels found nowhere else in Nepali temple architecture and is considered significant evidence of measure of 
appeasement required to placate Bhairav.
