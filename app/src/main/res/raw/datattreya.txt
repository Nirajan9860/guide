At the east end of Tachupal Tole, the eye-catching Dattatreya Temple was originally built in 1427, supposedly using the timber from a single tree. The slightly mismatched front porch was added later. The temple is dedicated to Dattatreya, a curious hybrid deity, blending elements of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Judging from the Garuda statue and the conch and chakra disc mounted on pillars supported by stone turtles in front of the temple, Vishnu seems to have come out on top.


The three-storey temple is raised above the ground on a brick and terracotta base, which is carved with erotic scenes, including unexpected humour where one bored-looking woman multitasks by washing her hair while being pleasured by her husband. The main steps to the temple are guarded by statues of the same two Malla wrestlers who watch over the first plinth of the Nyatapolo Temple.
Beside Dattatreya Temple consists of lots of other monuments that might catch your eyes. There is a two roofed Bhimsen Temple just opposite to the Dattatreya temple which consist of clay image of Bhimsen, the god of trade and commerce. He is portrayed with a red face, angry eyes and a thick black mustache. Back of the Bhimsen temple there is a very old deep water sprout whose exact date of construction is not known
There are two museums in the square which stand practically opposite to each other behind the Dattatreya temple. Named as “Pujari Math”, these buildings have some great examples of Bhaktapur’s wood carvings on display over 3 floors.
Last but not least one who is visiting this square shouldn’t miss to visit peacock window which is located down the side lane beside the woodcarving museum. It is a window carving of a peacock set high in a wall which dates back to 15th century. This window is also called as Mona Lisa of Nepal.
