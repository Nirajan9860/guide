Within the mysterious walls of Bhaktapur, you can discover a world that is untouched by westernization. The pottery square at
Bhaktapur upholds the traditional way of making clay vessels. The vessels are made from a special black clay known as Dyo Cha,
which literally means “clay of God”. Everyone has a role in the process of pottery-making, from young men and women to old men
and women. It’s the old men who use their graceful hands to shape the clay into traditional pots, not leaving the slightest crack.
Clear sunny days are the best for visiting the square as it is usually littered with several pots and vessels set for drying.
You can even try your hand at pottery in one of the workshops, but be warned, it’s not as easy as it looks. So, get your cameras
and experience a form of art that has been passed down through generations of Newar potters at Bhaktapur’s pottery square.
