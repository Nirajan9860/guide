Bhairav  and Bhadrakali are then placed in large chariots (locally known as Rathas) and pulled through crowds of cheering on lookers.
During the festival people replay a drama passed on over the centuries.The chariots, pause for a tug of war between the eastern and
western sides of town and then move down a steep road leading to a river, where a 25-m high lingo (vertical pole) is erected.6226In the evening the following day, the pole is pulled down, again in a tug of war and as the pole crashes as the official New Year commences.
