Biska Jatra, Bhaktapur's weeklong festival marks the ancient solar Nava Barsha (New Year) and is the only festival that does not follow the lunar-based Nepali calendar. The jatra commences after a special Tantric ritual in the Bhairab temple in Taumadhi Tole in Bhaktapur.
Bhairav and Bhadrakali are then placed in large chariots (locally known as Rathas) and pulled through crowds of cheering onlookers. During the festival people replay a drama passed on over the centuries.
The chariots, pause for a tug of war between the eastern and western sides of town and then move down a steep road leading to a river, where a 25-m high lingam (vertical pole) is erected. In the evening the following day, the pole is pulled down, again in a tug of war and as the pole crashes as the official New Year commences. There are lots of other customs within Biska Jatra that take place in the toles and galis(alleys) of Bhaktapur. There are different myths and legends of this festival which makes it even more watch worthy. Like any other local festivals, this festival doesnâ€™t lack music or enthusiasm of people to carry on the culture passed them by their ancestors.
Bisket Jatra is also celebrated in Thimi and Bode with Sindur Jatra and Jibro Chhedne Jatra respectively. The festivities conclude with several days of spiritual entrancement, dancing and merry-making.
