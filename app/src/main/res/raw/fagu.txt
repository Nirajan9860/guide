26Fagu Poornima, also known as Holi, the cultural festival of colors is celebrated differently in Bhaktapur. Normally,
Fagu is celebrated by smearing different colors and throwing color dissolved water at fellow revelers. But in the ancient
town of Bhaktapur, this festival starts with the installation of a pole symbolizing the phallus of the Hindu God Bhimsen
in front of Dattatreya Temple, amidst the singing of a Newari hymn with a sexual connotation. Devotees thronged to pay 
obeisance to this wooden pole about three feet long and 30 inches in diameter and cut in the shape of a human phallus.
However there are lots of youngster who celebrate holi with colors and water. Despite some modern twiks in the festival,
Bhaktpur seems to be able to hold on to the old ways of celebration which makes holi in this city different.62
